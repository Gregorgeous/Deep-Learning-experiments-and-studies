This repository contains two areas of work: 
1.  Two ML models I implemented from scratch: the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and the Logistic Regression models. 
2.  Two Deep Learning experiments where I build and compare Keras-based neural networks for sentiment analysis.

Both areas were made during two modules I took as part of my CS degree at Goldsmiths, University of London ("IS71039A: Artificial Intelligence" and "IS53051A: Machine Learning".
